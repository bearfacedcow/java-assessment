# My Most Recent Assessment Test
I am posting the code to my most recent Java Assessment test that I took for a prospective Java Developer position.

My purpose in posting this challenge to give prospective employers a perspective into my Java mindset. I have always had a test-driven mindset when it comes to object oriented programming, along with the mantra of "think complex - not complicated" in order to produce dependable working solutions. 

The challenge itself is outlined int the PDF.
