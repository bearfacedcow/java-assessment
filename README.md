Here's a solution to a recent Java Assessment test that I took recently.

My purpose in posting this challenge to give prospective employers a perspective into my Java mindset. I have always had a test-driven mindset when it comes to object oriented programming, along with the mantra of "think complex - not complicated" in order to produce dependable working solutions. 

The challenge itself is outlined int the PDF.
